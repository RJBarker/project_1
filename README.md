Bootcamp: Project 1

my question was to explore the metrics that affect popularity by category 
number of uploads 
number of subscribers 
knumber of viewings

other question was to check the relationship between the previous metrics over years from the first year of tested data up to date 

for the blogs uploads dominating due to size of files and interest around the world

entertainment and music dominating a cross the world in viewing and subscribing categories 

we noticed that over years the uploaing number significantly decreased due to switch into cloud industry and remote storage
