## Project Description   

Investigate what factors may have contributed to the growth and popularity of YouTube channels globally and within their own countries.


## Dataset Used

[Global YouTube Satistics 2023 - Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/global-youtube-statistics-2023)

This dataset contains the top 995 YouTube channels by subscriber count, with key statistics for each channel such as:
    
   - Number of Video Views  
   - Total Video Uploads  
   - Estimaged monthly/annual earnings  
   - Originating Country  
   - Key statistics for each Country  
       - Population  
       - Unemployment Rate  
       - Education Enrollment Rate  


## Analysis Questions   

We identified four questions to generate analysis on. Each team member answered a question. The questions and analysis are:

### Q1 - Which country has the most video uploads per capita? (@jkalsi1997)

---

### Q2 - Which category is the most popular as a whole, and for each country?

---

### Q3 - Does the Education Enrollment/Unemployment rate have a positive/negative correlation with the number of successful YouTube channels per country? (@RJBarker)

#### Visuals

#### Analysis

Education Enrollment  
    
- With a Pearson r score of 0.1, there is a very weak positive correlation between the number of YouTuber's and their respective country's Education Enrollment rate.  
- This dataset is only concerned with the top ~800 Global channels. It would be intereseting to look into more detail and compare the results between countries with the top and bottom Education Enrollment rates, on a broader selection of channels to view the correlation.  

Unemployment

- Although there is a slightly stronger correlation between 'Unemployment Rate' and '# YouTuber's', than compared to 'Education Enrollment', this is still on the weaker side.  
- The linear regression and correalation values have most likely been skewed due to the 'United States' point plot which consists of 289 YouTuber's and a Unemployment Rate of near 15%.  

---

### Q4 - Looking at the year channels were created, which channel has gained popularity the quickest, is there a clear metric that has contributed to this? (@

## Evaluation  

If we were to repeat this project again then there would be some adjustments we'd like to incorporate to improve the analysis, visualizations and dataset:

   - Next time we would produce map plots for a better visual of country specific data  
   - Make use of YouTube and Google APIâ€™s to obtain more dynamic data  
   - Due to size of the YouTube platform if we did the project again we would use a larger dataset focussed on the highest usage countries
