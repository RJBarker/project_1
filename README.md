## Project Description   

Investigate what factors may have contributed to the growth and popularity of YouTube channels globally and within their own countries.


## Dataset Used

[Global YouTube Satistics 2023 - Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/global-youtube-statistics-2023)

This dataset has the top 995 YouTube channels by subscriber count. It contains key statistics for each channel such as:
    
    - Number of Video Views  
    - Total Video Uploads  
    - Estimaged monthly/annual earnings  
    - Originating Country  
    - Key statistics for each Country  
        - Population  
        - Unemployment Rate  
        - Education Enrollment Rate  


## Analysis Questions   

We identified four questions to generate analysis on. Each team member answered a question. The questions and analysis are:

### Q1 - Which country has the most video uploads per capita? 


### Q2 - Which category is the most popular as a whole, and for each country?


### Q3 - Does the Education Enrollment/Unemployment rate have a positive/negative correlation with the number of successful YouTube channels per country?


### Q4 - Looking at the year channels were created, which channel has gained popularity the quickest, is there a clear metric that has contributed to this?
